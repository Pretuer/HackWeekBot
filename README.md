# Rules 

:robot: Bot Submission Rules :robot: 

:rotating_light: Remember to be careful with bot tokens, client secrets, and passwords when publishing to open source repositories. :rotating_light: 

You can rely on using something like a config file or environment variables not stored in the repository to avoid leaking confidential configuration settings.

:nitro: Teams or individuals must open source the code for their projects. We recommend GitHub for hosting your code repository.

:NitroBoost: All bots that are created for Discord Hack Week must be Open Sourced.

:WumpusNitro: Open source libraries can be used (so you don’t need to build your very own Discord API library, for example)

:discordLink: Teams or individuals can work on ideas that they’ve had before the event or have even worked on before (they just can’t reuse the same code)

:notepad_spiral: Teams or individuals are allowed to receive advice and support from people not on their team (user feedback/research/etc). A team or individual is not allowed to have an outside member help them build the actual bot.
